  <p style="font-size: 110%"><em> My name is <i>Yerassyl</i>. My surname is Amanzhol. I am 18. I was born in 2002 in Finland. I live in a small town Aktau. My address is 14 microdistrict, 37 house. My phone number is 7292-32-2-45. I am a student. I go to
      Astana IT University. I am a good student. I do well in all subjects. They say that I am a hard-working person. To tell the truth, all university subjects come easy to me but sometimes I have to work long hours, for example, to do lessons in
      Calculus or Math, to solve problems or to learn a new topic by heart. But my favourite subject is Web-technology. I spend a lot of time on it reading books, doing tests etc. Maybe Web technologies and learning it will be a part of my future
      carreer. I like construct the sites. I think comics and detective stories are much easier to read but I prefer to read novels - historical or modern. I like music. My musical tastes are different, it depends on my mood. But I think every apple
      is good in its season. I play the piano and the guitar, not seriously but for my soul. Sometimes I like to listen to Russian classical music. My favourite composers are Chaikovsky and Mozart. I also like English folk songs but I don't like rock
      music. I don't have much time to watch TV but sometimes I spend an hour or two watching an interesting film or a news programme. In the evening I often read newspapers (our local ones) or BBC. I like fresh air and exercise. I wish I had more
      time for doing sports. But some aerobics in the morning, a swimming pool twice a week, a ski-walk on a frosty day are of great help. Sport is fun. I have a wide circle of interests. I'm very sociable, so I get on very well with people. I have
      many friends, most of them are my classmates. We spend a lot of time together going out to the cinema or to a disco party, speaking about lessons and music, discussing our problems. But most of all I like my family. We all are great friends and
      deeply attached to each other. That's all about me - a person with his good and not very good traits of character, liking this and hating that. But it's interesting for me to live and to open new things.</em></p>
